# C++ Exercises

Welcome to the C++ Exercises repository! This is a collection of C++ programming exercises that I am working on as part of my learning journey. The repository contains various exercises ranging from beginner to advanced levels, showcasing different aspects of C++ programming.

## Contents

- **[Basic](./basic)**: Fundamental exercises covering basic syntax, operators, control structures, and functions.
- **[Intermediate](./intermediate)**: Exercises involving object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms.
- **[Advanced](./advanced)**: More complex problems focusing on advanced topics like templates, multithreading, and performance optimization.

## Getting Started

To get started with these exercises, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ramiro2114/cpp-exercises.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the directory**:

    ```bash
    cd cpp-exercises
    ```

3. **Compile and run exercises**:

    Navigate to the directory of the exercise you want to work on. Use a C++ compiler to compile the code. For example, using `g++`:

    ```bash
    g++ -o exercise_name exercise_name.cpp
    ./exercise_name
    ```

    Replace `exercise_name` with the appropriate file names.
